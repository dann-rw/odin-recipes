# odin-recipes
This project requires me to create a recipe website, based on all I have been learning in the html section of the curriculum. This should include a homepage with links to three other recipe pages. The aim is to practice my use of HTML language I have learned up to this point

Upon reflection now having completed this project, I have put to use a variety of skills across the terminal/command line, and html language. This includes; Creating directories and files from the command line, linking repositories and using git to continually save progress, typing up the boilerplate html template on the various files I created, adding titles, headings, text in the body, paragraphs, lists, and links to other pages and images. Finally, putting inot pactice uploading all of this to github.  

A further realisation is that a lot of my time was spent trying to understand if I had used the git commands correctly - I had - and playing around with that. The tasks themselves were good to re-enforce my memory of what I have learned over the past few lessons, and were a good prompt to go back over anything I may have needed to. This was true for Git basics, some information regarding links (what text I needed to include to ensure extra safety when opening into another tab, pathways), and re-enforcing my ability to type out the boilerplate and basics from memory.
